/**
 * @class strange.extensions.sequencer.impl.Sequencer
 * 
 * Runs SequenceCommands in sequential order.
 * 
 * A variation on the CommandBinder that runs Commands in sequence
 * rather than in parallel. Each SequenceCommand in the Sequence
 * Executes then terminates, and then the next SequenceCommand
 * continues the process. Any SequenceCommand in the series is
 * permitted to call `BreakSequence()` to terminate the chain.
