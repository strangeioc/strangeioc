/**
 * @interface strange.framework.api.IBinder
 * 
 * Collection class for bindings.
 * 
 * Binders are a collection class (akin to ArrayList and Dictionary)
 * with the specific purpose of connecting lists of things that are
 * not necessarily related, but need some type of runtime association.
 * Binders are the core concept of the StrangeIoC framework, allowing
 * all the other functionality to exist and further functionality to
 * easily be created.
 * 
 * Think of each Binder as a collection of causes and effects, or actions
 * and reactions. If the Key action happens, it triggers the Value
 * action. So, for example, an Event may be the Key that triggers
 * instantiation of a particular class.
