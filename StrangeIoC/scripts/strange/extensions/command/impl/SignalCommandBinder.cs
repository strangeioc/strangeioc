/**
 * @class strange.extensions.command.impl.SignalCommandBinder;
 * 
 * A Binder that triggers the instantiation of Commands using Signals.
 * 
 * Commands are where the logic of your application belongs.
 * These Commands typically focus on a single function, such as
 * adding a View, requesting a service, reading from or saving to a model.
 * 
 * The act of binding Signals to Commands means that code needn't know
 * anything about a Signal recipient, or even how the Signal will be used.
 * For example, a Mediator might dispatch a Signal that two View objects
 * collided. A Command would then determine that the result of that Signal
 * was to Destroy both objects, tell a ScoreKeeper model to change the
 * score and request a message be sent to the server. Whether that
 * example means one Command or three is up to your coding preference...
 * SignalCommandBinder can trigger one Command or multiple Commands off the
 * same Signal.
 * 
 * Signals bind their parameters to Command injections by comparing types and do not understand
 * named injections. Therefore, in order to Bind a Command's injections to a Signal,
 * PARAMETERS/INJECTIONS MUST BE OF UNIQUE TYPES. It is not, therefore, possible to bind a
 * Signal with two of the same type to a Command.
 * 
 * Note that like CommandBinder, SignalCommandBinder features sequencing. By default,
 * SignalCommandBinder fires all Commands in parallel. If your binding specifies `InSequence()`,
 * Commands will run serially, with the option of suspending the chain at any time.
 * 
 * Example bindings:

		Bind(someSignal).To<SomeCommand>();

		Bind<SomeSignalClass>().To<StartCommand>().Once(); //Destroy the binding immediately after a single use

		Bind<SomeSignalClass>().To<FirstCommand>().To<SecondCommand>().To<ThirdGCommand>().InSequence(); //Bind a sequence

 * 
 * See Command for details on asynchronous Commands and cancelling sequences.
