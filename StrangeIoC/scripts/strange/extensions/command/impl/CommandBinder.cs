/**
 * @class strange.extensions.command.impl.CommandBinder
 * 
 * A Binder that triggers the instantiation of Commands.
 * 
 * Commands are where the logic of your application belongs.
 * These Commands typically focus on a single function, such as
 * adding a View, requesting a service, reading from or saving to a model.
 * 
 * The act of binding events to Commands means that code needn't know
 * anything about an event recipient, or even how the event will be used.
 * For example, a Mediator might send out an event that two View objects
 * collided. A Command would then determine that the result of that event
 * was to Destroy both objects, tell a ScoreKeeper model to change the
 * score and request a message be sent to the server. Whether that
 * example means one Command or three is up to your coding preference...
 * CommandBinder can trigger one Command or multiple Commands off the
 * same event.
 * 
 * Note that CommandBinder also a features sequencing. By default, CommandBinder fires all
 * Commands in parallel. If your binding specifies `InSequence()`,  commands will run serially,
 * with the option of suspending the chain at any time.
 * 
 * Example bindings:

		Bind("someEvent").To<SomeCommand>(); //Works, but poor form to use strings. Use the next example instead

		Bind(EventMap.SOME_EVENT).To<SomeCommand>(); //Make it a constant

		Bind(ContextEvent.START).To<StartCommand>().Once(); //Destroy the binding immediately after a single use

		Bind(EventMap.END_GAME_EVENT).To<FirstCommand>().To<SecondCommand>().To<ThirdGCommand>().InSequence();

 * 
 * See Command for details on asynchronous Commands and cancelling sequences.
