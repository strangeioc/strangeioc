/**
 * @class strange.extensions.command.impl.Command
 * 
 * Commands are where you place your business logic.
 * 
 * In the MVCSContext setup, commands are mapped to IEvents. 
 * The firing of a specific event on the global event bus triggers 
 * the instantiation, injection and execution of any Command(s) bound to that event.
 * 
 * By default, commands are cleaned up immediately on completion of the `Execute()` method.
 * For asynchronous Commands (e.g., calling a service and awaiting a response),
 * call `Retain()` at the top of your `Execute()` method, which will prevent
 * premature cleanup. But remember, having done so it is your responsipility
 * to call `Release()` once the Command is complete.
 * 
 * Calling `Fail()` will terminate any sequence in which the Command is operating, but
 * has no effect on Commands operating in parallel.
