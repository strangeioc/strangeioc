/**
 * @class strange.extensions.signal.api.IBaseSignal
 * 
 * The API that defines the use of a Signal.
 * 
 * Signals are a type-safe approach to communication that essentially replace the
 * standard EventDispatcher model. Signals can be injected/mapped just like any other
 * object -- as Singletons, as instances, or as values. Signals can even be mapped
 * across Contexts to provide an effective and type-safe way of communicating
 * between the parts of your application.
 * 
 * Additionally, the SignalCommandMap allows you to map Signals to Commands,
 * in just the same way as you would map Events to Commands.
 * Note that Signals bind their parameters to Command injections by comparing Types
 * and do not understand named injections. Therefore, in order to Bind a Command's injections to a Signal,
 * PARAMETERS/INJECTION PAIRS MUST BE OF UNIQUE TYPES. So while Signals themselves are
 * allowed to have two parameters of the same Type, Signals mapped to Commands must never do
 * this.
 * 
 * Signals in Strange use the Action Class as the underlying mechanism for type safety.
 * Unity's C# implementation currently allows up to FOUR parameters in an Action, therefore
 * SIGNALS ARE LIMITED TO FOUR PARAMETERS. If you require more than four, consider
 * creating a value object to hold additional values.
 * 
 * Example uses in strange.extensions.signal.impl.Signal 
 * 
 * @see strange.extensions.signal.impl.BaseSignal
