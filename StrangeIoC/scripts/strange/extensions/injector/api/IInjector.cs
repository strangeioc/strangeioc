/**
 * @interface strange.extensions.injector.api.IInjector
 * 
 * Interface for the Injector, which dependencies into provided instances.
 * 
 * The Injector requests a ReflectedClass from the ReflectionBinder
 * and uses that information to inject an instance. Note that the Injector
 * itself does not instantiate the class. That is the job of the
 * InjectorFactory. That said, Factory and Reflector are 'hidden'
 * from the average user, since their jobs are pretty deep in the structure.
 * If you wish, you can override either or both.
 * 
 * Classes utilizing the injector must be marked with the following metatags:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>[Inject] - Use this metatag on any setter you wish to have supplied by injection.</li>
 *  <li>[Construct] - Use this metatag on the specific Constructor you wish to inject into when using Constructor injection. If you omit this tag, the Constructor with the shortest list of dependencies will be selected automatically.</li>
 *  <li>[PostConstruct] - Use this metatag on any method(s) you wish to fire directly after dependencies are supplied</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @see strange.extensions.reflector.api.IReflectionBinder
