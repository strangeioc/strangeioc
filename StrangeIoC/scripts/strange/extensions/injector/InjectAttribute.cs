/**
 * @class Inject
 * 
 * The `[Inject]` attribute marks a setter Injection point.
 * 
 * Example:

		[Inject]
		public IMyInterface myInstance{get;set;}

 * 
 * Inject tags can also specify a name:
 * 

 		[Inject(SomeEnum.VALUE)]
 		public IMyInterface myInstance{get;set;}


 * @class Name
 *  
 * When a parameter of a constructor or pseudo-constructor is tagged with [Name], 
 * the injector can discriminate between different classes that satisfy the same interface.  
 * This means that constructors and pseudo-constructors can used named injection just like 
 * setter injection.
 * 
 * @class Construct
 * 
 * The `[Construct]` attribute marks a preferred Constructor. If omitted,
 * the Reflector will mark as Constructor the shortest available
 * Constructor. Obviously, if there only one constructor, this tag
 * is not requried.
 * 
 * @class PseudoConstruct
 * 
 * The `[PseudoConstruct]` attribute marks a single method as the pseudo-constructor / initializer.
 * A pseudo-constructor is triggered after construction and before post-construction. Unlike 
 * '[PostConstruct]', '[PseudoConstruct]' accepts arguments, thus allowing you to inject 
 * dependencies into classes that prohibit constructor injection (e.g. MonoBehaviours).
 * 
 * @class PostConstruct
 * 
 * The `[PostConstruct]` attribute marks one or more methods as PostConstructors.
 * A PostConstructor is triggered immediately after injection. This allows
 * you to use use a PostConstructor in much the same way as a Constructor,
 * safe in the knowledge that there will be no null pointers on injected
 * dependencies. PostConstructors do not accept arguments.
 *
 * You may optionally include a priority int on your PostConstructor. This allows for multiple
 * PostConstruction methods which will fire in a predictable order.
 * 
 * @class Deconstruct
 * 
 * Unsupported.
